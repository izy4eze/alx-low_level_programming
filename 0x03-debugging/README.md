0x03. C - Debugging
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
Copy this main file. Comment out
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case
Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
